Various helm charts and yamls, tested mostly on [K3s](https://rancher.com/products/k3s/) cluster.
They use [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) as a storage solution.

Unused parts of code were cut out, so you may want to visit original charts for reference and comparison.
PVC's are enabled by default!

Each chart has its own readme inside, go there for detailed instructions.
